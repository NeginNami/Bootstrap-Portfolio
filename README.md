Bootstrap-Portfolio
 This a simple portfolio website which I made in purpose of education for myself.
 I made a nonresponsive portfolio website to a responsive one using bootstrap. 

How to see the result?
 There is no need to install anything. Just go to this URL: NeginNami.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio
 To see the responsiveness, resize the browser window and notice how the navbar and other elements change in different viewports.  

Built with: 
HTML
